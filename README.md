# Log In Form

In this project a made simple, but functional log in form with Flutter. It has validation, so it doesn't let user to enter an email without "@" or password shorter than 4 characters.
Unfortunately it doesn't have database or some kind of backend, but i hope i am goind to add it in the future.

## What I have learned

On this project I learned how to make forms and how to use form methods, like validate() or save(). Also i have learned how to make and use mixins in Flutter.
